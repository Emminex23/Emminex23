## ðŸš€ About Me
- Currently learning to be a software engineer at ALX Africa. I'm obsessed with how technology works and love building cool things.
- Python, Kubernetes, Docker, and Linux are my jam!
- Not just about the code â€“ I'm always figuring out how to solve problems in the smartest way possible.
- My background in technical writing means I care about clean, readable code and explaining how it works.
- I also write about code and tech stuff on [Hashnode](https://emminex.hashnode.dev/) â€“ check it out!

I'm a firm believer in collaboration and the sharing of ideas, so please feel free to connect with me:
